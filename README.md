## Introduction
This project is designed as a sandbox for learning and honing skills in Python development. It's a safe space to experiment, make mistakes, and learn from them. 

## Objectives
The main objectives of this project are:
1. **Python Development**: To learn and practice Python programming, including its syntax, standard libraries, and best practices.
2. **Open Source Workflow**: To understand the workflow of open-source projects, including version control systems, issue tracking, and code reviews.
3. **Collaboration using GitHub**: To learn how to effectively use GitHub for collaborative coding projects, including pull requests, merging, and conflict resolution.
4. **Working with CodeSpaces**: To gain experience with CodeSpaces, a development environment that allows you to work on your project from anywhere, without the need to set up a local development environment.

## Requirements
To participate in this project, you will need the following:
1. **Internet Access**: As this project is hosted on GitHub and uses CodeSpaces, a stable internet connection is required to access and interact with the project.
2. **GitHub Account**: You will need a GitHub account to contribute to the project. If you don't have one, you can create one for free at [github.com](https://github.com/).

## Setting Up CodeSpaces
To maximize the use of free GitHub CodeSpaces credits, we recommend setting an idle timeout of 30 minutes and an expiration date of one day for your CodeSpaces. Here's how to do it:
1. **Log in to GitHub**: Visit [github.com](https://github.com/) and log in to your account.
2. **Go to Your Profile**: Click on your profile picture in the top right corner of the GitHub homepage, then click on "Your profile".
3. **Access CodeSpaces Settings**: From your profile page, click on "Settings" in the top right corner. From the settings page, click on "Codespaces" in the left sidebar.
4. **Modify CodeSpaces Settings**: In the "Codespaces settings" section, set the "Idle timeout" to 30 minutes and the "Codespace expiration" to 1 day.

## Opening CodeSpaces
To work on this project using CodeSpaces, you will need to initiate a CodeSpace from the active pull request. Here's how to do it:
1. **Navigate to the Pull Request**: From the main page of the repository, click on the "Pull requests" tab. Find the active pull request and click on it.
2. **Open CodeSpaces**: In the pull request page, click on the "Code" button, then select "Open with CodeSpaces". This will initiate a new CodeSpace with the code from the pull request.
